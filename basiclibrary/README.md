### Lab-01:Java Primitives and Control Flow <br>
**Finished Tasks** :<br>

1-**Flipping Coins:** The written method that called flipNHeads  accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads<br> are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers <br>below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on <br>one line for each flip.and It Print took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.<br>

2- **Command Line Clock:** Write a method clock that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print <br>out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills <br>it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE. Each time should only be printed once. Your <br>program should detect when the seconds increase and only print something out when the timestamp changes.<br>
